# Q: Are there some utilities to import data from other VR applications? #

I'm just wondering if these utilities exists. It would be nice, for example, to convert my own demos from vrml to VR Juggler. If not, are you planning to develop them?

# A: VR Juggler is not a data loading tool. #

VR Juggler does not provide data loading capabilities.  User applications can be written to load data of any format to be viewed in any VR system, but VR Juggler does not (and will not) provide the features to do this automatically.  Using a scenegraph as part of a VR Juggler application, however, it is possible to load many data formats very easily, often without writing any custom application code.

Refer to the [model loading](ModelLoading.md) FAQ entry for more details about scenegraphs and loading different model formats.  This page lists existing applications that come with VR Juggler that will load many different model file formats.
