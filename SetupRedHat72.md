## Extra RPMs ##

### Required ###

### Recommended ###

  * DDD, the Data Display Debugger (RPM is `ddd`)
  * Some JDK/J2SDK installation, either 1.3.1 or 1.4.x.  These come from http://java.sun.com/

### Optional ###

The following RPMs can be installed, but they are not required.  GLUT would be needed to use some features of Open Scene Graph and !OpenSG.  NSPR would be needed to use the NSPR subsystem in VPR.

  * `glut`
  * `glut-devel`
  * `mozilla-nspr-devel`

The following optional packages come from external sources (rather than the base RedHat distribution):

  * omniORB 3.0.x
