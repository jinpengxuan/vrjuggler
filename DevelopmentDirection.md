# Current VR Juggler 2.0 Tasks/Projects #

## Cluster Support ##

  * The cluster support in VR Juggler 1.1 is being refactored to allow easier configuration.  The goal is to allow the same configuration files to be used on all machines in the cluster rather than individual files for each machine.

## Configuration Editing ##

  * The configuration editing aspect of VR Juggler 1.1 is being revamped in an effort to make it easier and more intuitive. Some features you can expect to see on the road to 2.0 include:
    * XML-based configuration files.
    * A unified interface to all configuration files. You should be able to edit multiple files together as though they are part of a single configuration.
    * A new generic configuration editor.
    * Support for customized editors that can take advantage of knowledge of what is being represented by a given configuration element.
    * Wizards to help walk you through common tasks.
    * Configuration element versioning.
    * Real-time validation of your configuration.
    * Integrated help.
    * Better documentation.
