# VjControl Overview #

VjControl is a Java-based GUI used to edit VR Juggler 1.0 configuration files and configuration description files.  It can also be used to monitor the performance of a running VR Juggler application and to reconfigure a running application.

With the release of VR Juggler 1.1 DR2, VjControl has been replaced with a new tool called [VRJConfig](VrjConfig.md).  VRJConfig is still in development, and the first release does not have every feature of previous releases of VjControl, but it has many capabilities that were not possible to implement in VjControl.
