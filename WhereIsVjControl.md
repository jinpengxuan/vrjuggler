# Q: Where is VjControl? #

I just downloaded a pre-compiled version of VR Juggler, and I can't find VjControl.  Where is it?

# A: As of VR Juggler 1.1 DR2, VjControl has been replaced by VRJConfig. #

For the VR Juggler 2.0 release, we are developing a completely new configuration editor called [VRJConfig](VrjConfig.md).  Based on our experience with VjControl and on user feedback, we have "gone back to the drawing board" to come up with a new editor.  It is based on [Tweek](http://www.vrjuggler.org/tweek/) and [JavaBeans](http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/) for easier extensibility, both by the developers and by the users.
