# Q: What is different between VR Juggler 1.0 and 2.0? #

I have heard talk about the upcoming VR Juggler 2.0 release.  What will be changed in VR Juggler 2.0?

**NOTE**: VR Juggler 2.0.0 has not been released yet!  It is still in development under the name VR Juggler 1.1.  VR Juggler 2.0 is currently in the beta testing phase, and 2.0.0 will be available soon.

# A: Conceptually, very little; Syntactically, many things. #

The differences between VR Juggler 1.0 and 2.0 are many, though they both have the same base set of goals and the same fundamental design.  The differences include API changes (mainly the use of C++ namespaces instead of the `vj` prefix), functionality changes to support important new features, and config file format enhancements, just to name a few.  Refer to the following documents for details on new features and how to migrate applications from VR Juggler 1.0 to 2.0:
