# VR Juggler Wiki #

This is the start page for the VR Juggler wiki on Google Code. The old [Trac-based wiki](http://developer.vrjuggler.org/) is still available, but it is no longer updated.

This knowledge base is not meant to serve as a replacement or a copy of the VR Juggler documentation. Instead, it is meant to support it by providing a place for discussion of VR Juggler related topics and to provide up-to-the-minute information about the current status of the project and the software.
